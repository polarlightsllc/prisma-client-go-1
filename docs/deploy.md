### Deploy

Deploying a Prisma Client Go adds a few more steps, because it depends on the Prisma query engine, which is a binary we
automatically download in your project path. Depending on where you deploy your code to, you might need to follow some
extra steps.

#### Set up go generate

While this step is not required, we recommend to use [`go generate`](https://blog.golang.org/generate) to simplify
generating the Prisma Client Go client. To do so, you can just put the following line into a go file, and then run go
generate so `go run github.com/polarlightsllc/prisma-client-go-1 generate` and any other generate commands you run will get
executed.

Put this line into a Go file in your project, usually in `main.go`:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/polarlightsllc/prisma-client-go-1 generate

func main() {
// ...
}
```

Now, run `go generate`:

```shell script
go generate ./...
```

Your Prisma Client Go code is now generated.

#### Using docker

When deploying with docker, the setup is super easy. Build your dockerfile as usual, run `go generate ./...` (
see [setting up go generate](#set-up-go-generate)), and you're good to go!

We also recommend using [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), which is recommended when using Go >
=1.13.

Your dockerfile could look like this. It uses Go modules, layered caching for fast docker builds and multiple stages for
lightweight images (usually a few megabytes).

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16 as build

WORKDIR /app

# add go modules lockfiles
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# prefetch the binaries, so that they will be cached and not downloaded on each change
RUN go run github.com/polarlightsllc/prisma-client-go-1 prefetch

COPY . ./

# generate the Prisma Client Go client
RUN go run github.com/polarlightsllc/prisma-client-go-1 generate
# or, if you use go generate to run the generator, use the following line instead
# RUN go generate ./...

# build the binary with all dependencies
RUN go build -o /main .

CMD ["/main"]
```
